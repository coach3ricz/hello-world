# hello-world
This is a basic intro project 




Hi my name is Eric and I love hockey.  My favorite team is the New York Rangers and my second favorite team is the Winnepeg Jets.  
I am a youth hockey coach for the Long Island Arrows and also a skill development coach for youth hockey across Long Island.
